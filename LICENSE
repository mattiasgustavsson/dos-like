This project makes use of libraries with multiple licenses. Most are in the 
public domain, but some are not. If you make your own project using this 
engine, you need to include all the licenses listed here. For simplicity, I
am re-licensing the public domain libraries under one common MIT license, to
reduce the number of licenses in this file. Do note that the original license
remains valid for each file as well, should you prefer it.

Note that this file is only about the files in source/libs and the file dos.h,
which is what makes up the engine itself. The samples code (all the .c files)
are each under their own respective license, as noted in each source file.
